      <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>Effective Date: 04/02/2025</p>
      <p>BeeSpoke (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is currently in prototype or early-access development. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our app (“App”).</p>
      <p>By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
      <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
      <p>Because the App is in prototype stage, we may collect limited data including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Personal Information: Such as your email address or name, only if you create an account or provide it voluntarily.</li>
        <li>Usage Data: Such as device type, browser, language, app interactions, and feature usage for testing and improvement purposes.</li>
        <li>Feedback: Any feedback or bug reports you submit may be stored and used to improve the app.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
      <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Operate and test the App</li>
        <li>Fix bugs and improve features</li>
        <li>Analyze usage patterns and performance</li>
        <li>Communicate with users (e.g., support, updates)</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>3. Data Security</h3>
      <p>We take reasonable steps to protect your information, but since this is a prototype, we cannot guarantee full security or data permanence. Please do not share sensitive personal information in the App.</p>
      
      <h3>4. Data Sharing</h3>
      <p>We do not sell or share your data with third parties for marketing. Data may be shared with third-party services we use for testing, analytics, or hosting (e.g., Firebase, Google Analytics), but only to the extent necessary.</p>
      
      <h3>5. Children's Privacy</h3>
      <p>The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>
      
      <h3>6. Changes to This Policy</h3>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy as the App evolves. Updates will be posted in the app or on our website, and the effective date will be changed accordingly.</p>
